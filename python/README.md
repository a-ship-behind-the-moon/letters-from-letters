# README - Python
Any implementation in Python resides within this folder or subfolders thereof.

## Dependencies
Python 3.8+ is required (for now) to boost exploration.

Developers are encouraged to use black for style and `pytest` for the tests.
 We should add virtual environment documentation soon, as this might be the reference implementation for the *MVP*.
